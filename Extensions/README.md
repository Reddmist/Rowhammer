# Extensions

## Description

Extensions to support DRAM mapping using 2MB pages in [hammertime](https://github.com/vusec/hammertime/) and [rowhammer-test](https://github.com/google/rowhammer-test/). In the latter there is also support for DRAM mapping (for Sandy Bridge) which makes the test more efficient. (hammertime included that functionality already)

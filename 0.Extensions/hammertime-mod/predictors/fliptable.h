/*
 * Fliptables --- efficient, binary lookup tables for rowhammer attacks
 *
 * A fliptable expresses the bitflips that occur on a particular DRAM chip when
 * "neighbour" rows an arbitrary distance away are being hammered.
 *
 * Fliptables are intended to be generated from rowhammer profiling runs.
 * Indeed, *any* valid `tools/profile' output can be losslessly expressed as one
 * or more fliptables. The reverse process -- losslessly going from binary
 * fliptables to human-readable profile output -- is also guaranteed.
 *
 * The particular details and conditions of the hammering are not recorded in
 * the file itself; use optional metadata files for that.
